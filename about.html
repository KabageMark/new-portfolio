    <p>my full names are Kabage Mark Chege. I just cleared highschool last year and i have decided to become a developer as career.I came to Moringa after hearing that it is a very good school for pople to come and learn programming.</p>
    <p>i come from Nakuru.i live in Nairbi with my parent in Ummoja.I take the bus inorder to come here to Moringa school every single day</p>
    <p>After moringa, i plan to be a full time developer since it is a job that i trully love and i hope to advance to other fields as artificial intelligence</p>
    <p>I was asked to repeat moringa prep.this is because my Independent Projects were not good and i came back to fix this situation</p>
